# AI Coding Agent Instructions for Team-Sync-Hub

## Project Overview
Team-Sync-Hub is an early-stage project intended to be built with Google AI Studio and Gemini. The repository currently contains minimal structure and is in its initial setup phase.

## Getting Started for Agents
- **Repository**: `kadircinek/Team-Sync-Hub` on GitHub
- **Current Status**: Foundational setup phase with single README.md placeholder
- **Primary Reference**: README.md (contains project vision and initial context)

## Architecture Guidance (To Be Established)
As the codebase develops, document:
- Major components and their responsibilities
- Data flow between services
- External API integrations (especially Google AI Studio/Gemini)
- Cross-cutting patterns and middleware

## Development Workflows (To Be Established)
When build, test, or deployment configurations are added, update this section with:
- Build commands and environments
- Test running procedures
- Common debugging patterns specific to this project
- CI/CD pipeline details

## Code Conventions (To Be Established)
As code patterns emerge, document:
- Naming conventions for key components
- Project-specific error handling approaches
- File organization principles
- Dependencies and package management practices

## Integration Points (To Be Established)
When integrations are implemented, document:
- Google AI Studio/Gemini API usage patterns
- Third-party service connections
- Authentication and configuration management
- Environment variable conventions

## Usage Notes
- This file will evolve as the codebase grows
- Update sections when new major components or patterns are introduced
- Reference specific files/directories as examples when documenting patterns
- Keep guidance focused on this project's unique approaches rather than generic best practices
